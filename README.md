* Dynamic enemies that try to follow the player.
* Player can hide from the enemies
* Rating system based on how long it took the player to complete the level

## Bugs
Below lists some bugs currently known in the game to be fixed.
* Walking Backwards: Currently with how the backwards walk is calculated
the camera and player do some funky movement. Update to allow walking back
without changing player direction would make the backward movement more fluid.
